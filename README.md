# The Front Office

### Description

A game all about managing a football team. Take over whichever team you chose and control all aspects of the roster. Sign free
agents, make trades and draft rookies all in the hope of winning it all. Each player has a rating corresponding to their skill
level and can gain/lose rating based off age, potential, and just pure random change. Play with/without the pressure of being
fired due to poor preformance all the while balancing the performance of the current team and the future of the franchise.
Will you win it big and bring home a championship to your favourite city? Or will the pressure of the brightest lights shining
directly on you cause you to crumble. Play now and find out if you have what it takes.
